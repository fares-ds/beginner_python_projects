# Quiz Game with Python

In this python project we build a simple quiz application for terminal.

In this project, you will learn how to:

- Interact with user in the terminal
- How to use python dictionary objects

## Project Description

We have a python dictionary of `10` scientist as keys and there inventions as values:

```python
question_dict = {
    'Ballpoint pen': 'Biro Brothers', 'Jet Engine': 'Sir Frank Whittle',
    'Gramophone': 'Thomas Alva Edison', 'Internal Combustion Engine': 'Otto',
    'The Spinning Jeny': 'James Hargreaves', 'the small pox vaccine': 'Edward Jenner',
    'Railway air brakes': 'George Westinghouse', 'Electric streetcar': 'Thomas Davenport',
    'Electric Generator': 'Michal Faraday', 'Gun Powder': 'Roger Bacon'
    }
```

You need to iterate through the dict keys (inventions) and give the user 4 choices (scientist name), be sure that the choices are random and includes the right answer. The output should look like this:

```console
Q_1 - How invent Electric streetcar
    1 - Roger Bacon
    2 - Sir Frank Whittle
    3 - George Westinghouse
    4 - Thomas Davenport
Enter your choice : 
```

# Summary:
This Python script is a simple quiz game that tests the user's knowledge of inventors and their inventions. The questions and answers are stored in a dictionary question_dict, with the invention as the key and the inventor as the value.

The script starts by randomly shuffling the questions in question_dict using the random.shuffle() method, and storing the result in a list question_list. The script then loops through the shuffled list and presents the user with a multiple choice question for each item.

The choices for each question are generated by randomly shuffling a list of the possible answers, which includes the right answer, and removing three incorrect answers. The user is prompted to enter their answer and the script evaluates the response. If the answer is correct, the user's mark is incremented by 1, and if the answer is incorrect, the user's mark is decremented by 0.5.

Finally, the script prints the user's total score out of 10 and the number of questions they got right.
